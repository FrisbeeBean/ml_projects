I am Rishabh Jain and this is my version of making the rag based q&a bot

There are 5 pdfs attached in the folder itself that are used as the data for the q&a

For the ease of importing all the libraries in python I included the requirements.txt file

The actual backend code behind the chatbot is inside the langchain_fullcode_chatbot.py file

The frontend is in the tempalates folder in the index.html file

And for the last part a .ipynb file is also included which includes the code of both python and html and also the screenshots of some important questions
